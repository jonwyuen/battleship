## About

My implementation of the classic game [Battleship](https://jonwyuen.github.io/battleship) built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Besides improved performance, I decided to use pure JavaScript without any libraries because I wanted to show my deep understanding of the language. I also used an Object Oriented Design pattern with classes for more reusable code.

## How To Play

* Two players with the player starting randomly selected.
* Each player starts with five ships randomly placed onto their boards. 
* The ships include
    * Carrier - 5 hits
    * Battleship - 4 hits
    * Cruiser - 3 hits
    * Submarine - 3 hits
    * Destroyer - 2 hits
* Each player take turns firing at each other's board until a player sinks all of the other's ships.
* Each players board with ship locations and coordinates fired at can be found in the console.

* Open index.html on your browser.
* Enjoy!
